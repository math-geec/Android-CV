# Android-CV

Style Transfer app based on the idea in [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). 

Two potential approaches:
* Model on device, i.e. deploy the model in the app with TensorFlow Lite. Work in branch [TFlite](https://github.com/math-geec/Android-CV/tree/TFlite).
* Connect external model through API request. Work in branch [pythonAPI](https://github.com/math-geec/Android-CV/tree/pythonAPI).
